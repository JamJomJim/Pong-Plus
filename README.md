# Pong-Plus [![Google Play Badge](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vandykeewens.pongplus)
A Pong game a friend and I made for funsies and to mess around with LibGDX and games in general. If you choose to peruse the source code, please keep in mind we had much less experience at the time of creating this :P

Play the classic pong you know and love, or pong with:
* Customizable options - change everything about the ball and paddle.
* Local multiplayer pong - challenge your friends to a game of pong.
* Multiple difficulties - play a relaxing game of pong, take on the impossible AI, or customize the difficulty to your liking.
* Target practice and survival - improve your pong in these endless modes.
* AI battles - watch two AIs duke it out in a pong match for the ages.
